            <h1>The Cryptid in the Woods</h1>
            <h2>October 15th, 2024</h2>
            <p>
               This happened early in the morning as I was walking to my bus stop. 
               I was listening to music when I saw <i>two pale grey humanoid</i> streak 
               across an empty field across the road. I was so cauaght off guard 
               since I was listening to music and waiting for my friend. <b>They were 
               on all fours and had heads reminiscent of dogs.</b> It really creeped me 
               out since it was about 6:30 in the morning. I haven't read or heard 
               about things like this, but rural pennyslvania is a <b>hotspot</b> for 
               cryptids that run through the backwoods.
